        "I'm a freelancing web developer that dream about becoming front-end dev",
      decription: `My first contact with the front end was in 2018,
 since then Iâ€™ve been trying to learn new technologies
 and expand my knowledge in my spare time.\n
I believe that the main reason is that front-end development
 satisfies my need for creativity is that it allows me to easily
 put my ideas into digital form and see the results. 
Also I'm really curious about the technologies and
 fact that there is always something I can do better
 and learn something new so it keeps me passionatate.`,
